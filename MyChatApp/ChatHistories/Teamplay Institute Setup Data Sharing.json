This institute serves as the central hub for remote reading services for customers.  \n\n2. **Customer-Specific Setup**:  \n   - Each customer has their own registered Teamplay Institute, with the corresponding receiver installed on their premises.  \n   - Each customer is assigned a unique serial number to ensure data segregation.  \n\n3. **Data Handling Process**:  \n   - Customers upload their data to their own Teamplay Institute.  \n   - Data sharing with our team is facilitated via the **\u0022cross-institute compartment sharing\u0022** feature, enabling secure collaboration between institutions.  \n\n4. **AIRC Usage**:  \n   - The **AIRC** is exclusively purchased and utilized within the NAAM RaaS AIEP under the RaaS framework. It is used to manage and process all customer data through this dedicated institute.  \n\nThis structure was discussed during the Solution Architecture call with the RSC team. Please let me know if further details are needed.  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n\n--- \n\nThis version organizes information logically, reduces redundancy, and ensures key points are easily digestible.
